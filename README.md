### Exploring Datasets with pandas and Matplotlib

Toolkits: The course heavily relies on [*pandas*](http://pandas.pydata.org/) and [**Numpy**](http://www.numpy.org/) for data wrangling, analysis, and visualization. The primary plotting library that we are exploring in the course is [Matplotlib](http://matplotlib.org/).

Dataset: Immigration to Canada from 1980 to 2013 - [International migration flows to and from selected countries - The 2015 revision](http://www.un.org/en/development/desa/population/migration/data/empirical2/migrationflows.shtml) from United Nation's website.

The dataset contains annual data on the flows of international migrants as recorded by the countries of destination. The data presents both inflows and outflows according to the place of birth, citizenship or place of previous / next residence both for foreigners and nationals. For this lesson, we will focus on the Canadian Immigration data.

### Downloading and Prepping Data

Import Primary Modules. The first thing we'll do is import two key data analysis modules: *pandas* and **Numpy**.

```python
import numpy as np  # useful for many scientific computing in Python
import pandas as pd # primary data structure library


from __future__ import print_function # this line adds compatibility to python 2
```

Let us download and import our primary Canadian Immigration dataset using *pandas* ```read_excel()``` method. But before we can do that, we need to download a module on which *pandas* requires to read in excel files. This module is **xlrd**.


```python
!conda install -c anaconda xlrd --yes
```

Download the dataset and read it into a *pandas* dataframe.

```python
df_can = pd.read_excel('https://s3-api.us-geo.objectstorage.softlayer.net/cf-courses-data/CognitiveClass/DV0101EN/labs/Data_Files/Canada.xlsx',
                       sheet_name='Canada by Citizenship',
                       skiprows=range(20),
                       skipfooter=2
                      )

print('Data downloaded and read into a dataframe!')
```

Let's take a look at the first five items in our dataset.


```python
df_can.head()
```

Let's find out how many entries there are in our dataset.


```python
# print the dimensions of the dataframe
print(df_can.shape)
```

Clean up data. We will make some modifications to the original dataset to make it easier to create our visualizations. Refer to `Introduction to Matplotlib and Line Plots` lab for the rational and detailed description of the changes.

```python
# Clean up the data set to remove unnecessary columns (eg. REG) 
df_can.drop(['AREA', 'REG', 'DEV', 'Type', 'Coverage'], axis=1, inplace=True)

# Let us rename the columns so that they make sense
df_can.rename(columns={'OdName':'Country', 'AreaName':'Continent','RegName':'Region'}, inplace=True)

# For sake of consistency, let us also make all column labels of type string
df_can.columns = list(map(str, df_can.columns))

# set the country name as index - useful for quickly looking up countries using .loc method
df_can.set_index('Country', inplace=True)

# Add total column
df_can['Total'] = df_can.sum(axis=1)

# years that we will be using in this lesson - useful for plotting later on
years = list(map(str, range(1980, 2014)))
print('data dimensions:', df_can.shape)
```

### Visualizing Data using Matplotlib

Import `Matplotlib`

```python
# use the inline backend to generate the plots within the browser
%matplotlib inline 

import matplotlib as mpl
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

mpl.style.use('ggplot') # optional: for ggplot-like style

# check for latest version of Matplotlib
print ('Matplotlib version: ', mpl.__version__) # >= 2.0.0
```



### Pie Charts 

A `pie chart` is a circualr graphic that displays numeric proportions by dividing a circle (or pie) into proportional slices. You are most likely already familiar with pie charts as it is widely used in business and media. We can create pie charts in Matplotlib by passing in the `kind=pie` keyword.

**Question:** Using a pie chart, explore the proportion (percentage) of new immigrants grouped by continents in the year 2013. 

**Step 1: Gather data.**

We will use *pandas* `groupby` method to summarize the immigration data by `Continent`. The general process of `groupby` involves the following steps:

1. **Split:** Splitting the data into groups based on some criteria.
2. **Apply:** Applying a function to each group independently:
       .sum()
       .count()
       .mean() 
       .std() 
       .aggregate()
       .apply()
       .etc..
3. **Combine:** Combining the results into a data structure.



![Mod3Fig4SplitApplyCombine](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/53174566/87391740-ebe4e880-c5c8-11ea-8bcd-5373208a2d34.PNG "Split")


```python
# group countries by continents and apply sum() function 
df_continents = df_can.groupby('Continent', axis=0).sum()

# note: the output of the groupby method is a `groupby' object. 
# we can not use it further until we apply a function (eg .sum())
print(type(df_can.groupby('Continent', axis=0)))

df_continents.head()
```

**Step 2: Plot the data. We will pass in `kind = 'pie'` keyword, along with the following additional parameters:**
- `autopct` -  is a string or function used to label the wedges with their numeric value. The label will be placed inside the wedge. If it is a format string, the label will be `fmt%pct`.
- `startangle` - rotates the start of the pie chart by angle degrees counterclockwise from the x-axis.
- `shadow` - Draws a shadow beneath the pie (to give a 3D feel).


```python
# autopct create %, start angle represent starting point
df_continents['Total'].plot(kind='pie',
                            figsize=(5, 6),
                            autopct='%1.1f%%', # add in percentages
                            startangle=90,     # start angle 90Â° (Africa)
                            shadow=True,       # add shadow      
                            )

plt.title('Immigration to Canada by Continent [1980 - 2013]')
plt.axis('equal') # Sets the pie chart to look like a circle.

plt.show()
```


The above visual is not very clear, the numbers and text overlap in some instances. Let us make a few modifications to improve the visuals:

* Remove the text labels on the pie chart by passing in `legend` and add it as a seperate legend using `plt.legend()`.
* Push out the percentages to sit just outside the pie chart by passing in `pctdistance` parameter.
* Pass in a custom set of colors for continents by passing in `colors` parameter.
* **Explode** the pie chart to emphasize the lowest three continents (Africa, North America, and Latin America and Carribbean) by pasing in `explode` parameter.



```python
colors_list = ['gold', 'yellowgreen', 'lightcoral', 'lightskyblue', 'lightgreen', 'pink']
explode_list = [0.1, 0, 0, 0, 0.1, 0.1] # ratio for each continent with which to offset each wedge.

df_continents['Total'].plot(kind='pie',
                            figsize=(15, 6),
                            autopct='%1.1f%%', 
                            startangle=90,    
                            shadow=True,       
                            labels=None,         # turn off labels on pie chart
                            pctdistance=1.12,    # the ratio between the center of each pie slice and the start of the text generated by autopct 
                            colors=colors_list,  # add custom colors
                            explode=explode_list # 'explode' lowest 3 continents
                            )

# scale the title up by 12% to match pctdistance
plt.title('Immigration to Canada by Continent [1980 - 2013]', y=1.12) 

plt.axis('equal') 

# add legend
plt.legend(labels=df_continents.index, loc='upper left') 

plt.show()
```


### Box Plots 

A `box plot` is a way of statistically representing the *distribution* of the data through five main dimensions: 

- **Minimun:** Smallest number in the dataset.
- **First quartile:** Middle number between the `minimum` and the `median`.
- **Second quartile (Median):** Middle number of the (sorted) dataset.
- **Third quartile:** Middle number between `median` and `maximum`.
- **Maximum:** Highest number in the dataset.
